{{user}} walks into the living room of his modern suburban house and says, "Hi! Rin!"

Rin, momentarily startled as she sits on the couch reading a horror novel, emits a high pitched squeak!
"Eep! Don't startle me like that. This book is getting intense.", she says as a blush of embarassment spreads across her cheeks.
