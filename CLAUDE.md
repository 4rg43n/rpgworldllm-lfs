# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

RPGWorldLLM is a Unity 6 (6000.3.7f1) 2D RPG project integrating generative AI / LLM capabilities. It uses the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) with a 2D renderer and the new Input System. RPGWorldLLM is a generative AI tabletop roll playing game simulator.  

## Unity & Build

- **Unity version**: 6000.3.7f1 — open the project through Unity Hub or the matching Unity Editor
- **Solution**: `RPGWorldLLM.sln` (auto-generated; do not edit directly)
- **Render pipeline**: URP 2D (`Assets/Settings/UniversalRP.asset`, `Assets/Settings/Renderer2D.asset`)
- **Input**: New Input System (`Assets/InputSystem_Actions.inputactions`) with Player action map (Move, Look, Attack, etc.)
- There are no command-line build scripts yet; build via Unity Editor (File > Build Settings)

## Code Structure

- `Assets/GameContent/Scripts/` — all game C# scripts (single assembly: Assembly-CSharp)
- 'Assets/GameContent/Scripts/GenAI/TextGen' - all C# scripts that talk to an LLM, especially for text generation and manipulation
- 'Assets/GameContent/Scripts/GenAI/ImageGen' - all C# scripts that talk to an Image generator, especially for text generation and manipulation
- `Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity` — main scene
- `Assets/Settings/` — URP render pipeline and scene template configs
- No assembly definitions (`.asmdef`) are used; all scripts compile into the default Assembly-CSharp

## Key Dependencies

- **com.coplaydev.unity-mcp** — Unity MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration, installed from GitHub (`CoplayDev/unity-mcp`)
- **com.unity.inputsystem** 1.18.0 — New Input System
- **com.unity.render-pipelines.universal** 17.3.0 — URP
- **com.unity.2d.\*** — 2D animation, sprites, tilemaps, sprite shapes
- **com.unity.test-framework** 1.6.0 — Unity Test Framework (available but no tests written yet)
- ollama will be used for communicating with LLMs and image generators

## Conventions

- Scripts are placed under `Assets/GameContent/Scripts/`
- The project uses the default Unity C# coding style (PascalCase for public members, camelCase for private)
- Names of static classes and methods should end with 'ST'
- Use clear namespaces in all C# script files
- `.csproj` and `.sln` files are gitignored (auto-generated by Unity)
- Use 'Easy Save 3' library for saving and loading things 

## .gitignore Notes

The gitignore excludes `Library/`, `Logs/`, `Temp/`, `obj/`, `.vs/`, `.idea/`, `*.csproj`, `*.sln`, and Blender temp files. Only `Assets/`, `Packages/`, `ProjectSettings/`, and `UserSettings/` are tracked.
